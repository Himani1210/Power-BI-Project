# Power-BI-Project

Objective
The primary objective of this HR Analytics Dashboard is to analyze employee data across the three key departments – Human Resources (HR), Research & Development (R&D), and Sales – to identify the main factors driving employee attrition. It aims to uncover patterns in demographics, salaries, job roles, education, and satisfaction levels, enabling HR to take data-driven decisions for better retention strategies.
